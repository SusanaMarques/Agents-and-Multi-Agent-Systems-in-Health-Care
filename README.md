# Agents and Multi Agent Systems in Health-Care

In recent years, agent-based systems have become a growing approach to address medicine limitations and are distinguished by their decision-making and management characteristics that affect complex communication between medical departments. The introduction of multi-agent systems in medicine ensures communication and coordination, minimizing errors in analysis and treatment, and improving the time required for doctors to communicate with others.

With this in mind, the following project was developed, which consists of harvesting and searching different applications and multi-agent systems in the health field with the aim of understanding what is the next step to take for scientific advances in the junction of artificial intelligence and medicine.

Concepts learned with this work:

- Multi-Agent System: MAS
- Jade
- Decision Support Systems
- Healthcare Information Systems Using Agent Technology
- Multi-Agent Architecture
